Excercise to re-inforce merging datasets in SAS

This assignment was to use HTTPS to pull partial data sets from other students github accounts programmatically in SAS and merge all into the final data set. Due to SASUniversity Edition's non-support for the https, the data was downloaded manually. The data sets were loaded into SAS, processed, merged and exported into satEdata.csv as the final output.

The merged fields in the new data set run ffrom PctMalesNeverMarried through the last field.
